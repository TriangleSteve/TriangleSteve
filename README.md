- 👋 Hi, I’m @TriangleSteve
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, business intelligence, databases, and servers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, postgresql, tableau, ASP.NET, and anything else that will help create data solutions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [shrug]... I don't know that anyone will be collaborating with me on these, I'm going it alone
- 📫 How to reach me: point the bat-signal to the sky... I will find you
